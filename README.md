# Portfolio Website

My portfolio website - it is currently under construction.
I aim to detail my personal projects and motivations, as well as trying out libraries such as framer motion and more.

I will be using next.js and tailwind.css to create this website.
The aim of this website is to provide a creative outlet for myself to showcase my experiences and projects.
